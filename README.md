# COVID-19-Tracker

https://covid-19-tracker-cc.herokuapp.com/

Yet another COVID-19 tracker web app... but at least this one is ad-less, clutter-less, searchable, and sortable. 

Dataset is sourced from the [Johns Hopkins CSSE 2019-nCoV repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) everyday around 23:59 UTC

Mostly just a toy project to introduce some non-coding friends how to use the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)

Inspired by [koushikkothagal's tracker app](https://github.com/koushikkothagal/coronavirus-tracker)
